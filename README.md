# Remote JS developer jobs!

This project was born out of hunting for jobs that need the skills that I developed as a Lambda School Full Stack Web Development student. This app was built using technology that was taught, and some new techonolgies to stretch my learning. The three major new techonologies are RecoilJS for state management, Auth0 for industry standard SSO, and MongoDB for the database.
